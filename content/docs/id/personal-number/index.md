If you are going to stay in Sweden for more than one year, you should apply for a personal identity number. It is necessary for you to do a lot of things, for example opening a bank account in Sweden.

To apply for a personal identity number, you need to visit Swedish Tax Agency in person.

Two Swedish Tax Agency offices are close to the city center:

- Första Långgatan 1, 413 27 Göteborg
- Östra Hamngatan 16, 411 09 Göteborg

You need to bring your passport and your residence permit card.

Refer to [this page](https://www.skatteverket.se/servicelankar/otherlanguages/inenglishengelska/individualsandemployees/livinginsweden/idcard.4.7be5268414bea064694c420.html) for more information.

Most of the times, you can drop in to the Swedish Tax Agency and just tell the stuff there you want to have a personal identify number, and then they'll tell you what to do.

If you want to save your time, you can fill the form [here](https://www7.skatteverket.se/portal/flytta-till-sverige-anmalan/bakgrund) and print it out and bring it with you when visiting the tax agency. However, there are free printing services in the Swedish Tax Agency, you may also fill the form and print it out there.
