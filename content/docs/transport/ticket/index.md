Hint: You'll need to buy a ticket for whole day, "Fritid" ticket is not for students.

## Zones

If you just want to take the bus around the campus, around the city center, go to IKEA, to the supermarkets, etc, you'll only need to buy a ticket for zone A.

An exception is that if you want to go to the airport, you'll need to buy a ticket which includes zone B.

You can always check the zones [here](https://www.vasttrafik.se/reseplanering/hallplatser/).
