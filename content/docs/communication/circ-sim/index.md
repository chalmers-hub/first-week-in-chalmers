If you cannot receive the OTP code, you may try to top up by yourself:

On [lycamobile website](https://www.lycamobile.se/en/), click "Quick top up".

Fill in your phone number, and select the top-up amount you need. (50kr is enough if you don't want to use this card forever).

You don't need to add a bundle, CIRC has brought a prepaid one for you.
